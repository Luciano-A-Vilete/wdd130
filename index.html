            <h3>History of Pernambuco</h3>
            <p>The history of the state of Pernambuco is marked by numerous conflicts. As one of the oldest states in
                the
                Federation, it has been targeted by invasions and uprisings since of the Discovery of Brazil.The
                territory
                where the state of Pernambuco currently is, was first named Capitania Luzitânia. The area was granted by
                the
                Portuguese Crown to Duarte Coelho in 1535. Coelho settled in Olinda, which was the first capital of the
                state.

                In 1537, the islands of Igarassu and Olinda were founded. The region experienced economic growth with
                the
                installation of sugarcane and cotton plantations.

                From 1630 to 1654, the territory was occupied by the Dutch. The invaders burned Olinda and named Recife
                as
                their capital in the Brazilian territory.

                At the head of the Dutch government was Count Maurício de Nassau. During his stay in the region, the
                count
                implemented significant changes in the social, economic, and cultural matrix.

                The presence of the Portuguese Europeans, however, was solidified. There were also enslaved African
                blacks
                and Indians. Representatives of the three peoples managed to expel the Dutch.

                A new conflict marked the region in 1710, with the War of the Mascates. The conflict involved Portuguese
                traders and landlords of engenho from Olinda.

                A century later, in 1817, a wave of discontent hit the region and triggered the Pernambucan Revolution.
                This
                separatist movement gave rise to the Confederation of the Equador and inspired the Proclamation of the
                Republic.

                The ideals were taken up again with the outbreak of the Praieira Rebellion (1848-1850), the last of the
                imperial period</p>
